## Improvements

The project came to me as well-designed, fully functioning site. To fulfill the client's requirements, I added semantic HTML elements, which will improve the page's search engine optimization and make it more accessible to viewers of all kinds. Additionally, I fixed a broken link and refactored CSS code to make some consolidations.
